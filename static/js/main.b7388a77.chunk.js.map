You're right.\\n- At Honex, we constantly strive`,\n  `to improve every aspect\\nof bee existence.`,\n  `These bees are stress-testing\\na new helmet technology.`,\n  `- What do you think he makes?\\n- Not enough.`,\n  `Here we have our latest advancement,\\nthe Krelman.`,\n  `- What does that do?\\n- Catches that little strand of honey`,\n  `that hangs after you pour it.\\nSaves us millions.`,\n  `Can anyone work on the Krelman?`,\n  `Of course. Most bee jobs are\\nsmall ones. But bees know`,\n  `that every small job,\\nif it's done well, means a lot.`,\n  `But choose carefully`,\n  `because you'll stay in the job\\nyou pick for the rest of your life.`,\n  `The same job the rest of your life?\\nI didn't know that.`,\n  `What's the difference?`,\n  `You'll be happy to know that bees,\\nas a species, haven't had one day off`,\n  `in 27 million years.`,\n  `So you'll just work us to death?`,\n  `We'll sure try.`,\n  `Wow! That blew my mind!`,\n  `\"What's the difference?\"\\nHow can you say that?`,\n  `One job forever?\\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.`,\n  `I'm relieved. Now we only have\\nto make one decision in life.`,\n  `But, Adam, how could they\\nnever have told us that?`,\n  `Why would you question anything?\\nWe're bees.`,\n  `We're the most perfectly\\nfunctioning society on Earth.`,\n  `You ever think maybe things\\nwork a little too well here?`,\n  `Like what? Give me one example.`,\n  `I don't know. But you know\\nwhat I'm talking about.`,\n  `Please clear the gate.\\nRoyal Nectar Force on approach.`,\n  `Wait a second.

I love it!`,\n  `- I wonder where they were.\\n- I don't know.`,\n  `Their day's not planned.`,\n  `Outside the hive, flying who knows\\nwhere, doing who knows what.`,\n  `You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen\\nJock. You have to be bred for that.`,\n  `Right.`,\n  `Look. That's more pollen\\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.`,\n  `It's just a status symbol.\\nBees make too much of it.`,\n  `Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it\\nand the ladies see you wearing it.`,\n  `Those ladies?\\nAren't they our cousins too?`,\n  `Distant. Distant.`,\n  `Look at these two.`,\n  `- Couple of Hive Harrys.\\n- Let's have fun with them.`,\n  `It must be dangerous\\nbeing a Pollen Jock.`,\n  `Yeah. Once a bear pinned me\\nagainst a mushroom!`,\n  `He had a paw on my throat,\\nand with the other, he was slapping me!`,\n  `- Oh, my!\\n- I never thought I'd knock him out.`,\n  `What were you doing during this?`,\n  `Trying to alert the authorities.`,\n  `I can autograph that.`,\n  `A little gusty out there today,\\nwasn't it, comrades?`,\n  `Yeah. Gusty.`,\n  `We're hitting a sunflower patch\\nsix miles from here tomorrow.`,\n  `- Six miles, huh?\\n- Barry!`,\n  `A puddle jump for us,\\nbut maybe you're not up for it.`,\n  `- Maybe I am.\\n- You are not!`,\n  `We're going 0900 at J-Gate.`,\n  `What do you think, buzzy-boy?\\nAre you bee enough?`,\n  `I might be. It all depends\\non what 0900 means.`,\n  `Hey, Honex!`,\n  `Dad, you surprised me.`,\n  `You decide what you're interested in?`,\n  `- Well, there's a lot of choices.\\n- But you only get one.`,\n  `Do you ever get bored\\ndoing the same job every day?`,\n  `Son, let me tell you about stirring.`,\n  `You grab that stick, and you just\\nmove it around, and you stir it around.`,\n  `You get yourself into a rhythm.\\nIt's a beautiful thing.`,\n  `You know, Dad,\\nthe more I think about it,`,\n  `maybe the honey field\\njust isn't right for me.`,\n  `You were thinking of what,\\nmaking balloon animals?`,\n  `That's a bad job\\nfor a guy with a stinger.`,\n  `Janet, your son's not sure\\nhe wants to go into honey!`,\n  `- Barry, you are so funny sometimes.\\n- I'm not trying to be funny.`,\n  `You're not funny!
